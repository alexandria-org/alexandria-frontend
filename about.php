	<p>Alexandria.org is a non-profit, ad free search engine. Our goal is to provide the best available information without compromise.</p>

	<p>The index is built on data from Common Crawl and the engine is written in C++. The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/alexandria-org">here</a>.</p>

	<p>We are still at an early stage of development and running the search engine on a shoestring budget.</p>

	<p>Please contact us at info@alexandria.org if you want to get involved, want to support this initiative or have any questions.</p>
